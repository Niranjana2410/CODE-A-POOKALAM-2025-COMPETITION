 🎨 My Pookalam

Description:
Onam in Kerala feels like a season when the land itself comes alive, with stories of King Mahabali’s return woven into every smile and celebration. It’s not just a festival, but a homecoming of joy, where families gather, feast, and share in traditions that have lasted centuries.
✨
 At the heart of it all lies the pookkalam❇️, a breathtaking floral design that blooms at every doorstep.
It is a symbol of harmony, prosperity, and the warm welcome extended during Onam.

 In this design, six concentric circles represent the eternal cycle of life, unity and continuity, each carefully divided into square partitions that showcase colors arranged in balance and beauty. At the very heart rests a yellow centre circle, radiating brightness and positivity, surrounded by six pink petals symbolizing love, compassion, and the blossoming of joy. Together, the circles and petals weave a tapestry of tradition, where geometry and nature meet to create a vibrant expression of Onam’s spirit.
